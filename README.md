The README file of the iOS app for DinnerSystem.

It's the first project for me and I'm glad it can be better and better. I know it is not as good as the commercial-apps outside, but I think it's good enough for me. Of course, it needs to be going on for much more functionalities, but since I'm also currently learning Kotlin(Android) by my self, I choose to pause the thinking of adding more things in the App until I made the Android version useable or I get any further instructions. Of course, I'll fix the bug immediately when I found it, since its stable now, so I think I won't make too many things here recently. (Or will I?)
I'm writing to here, and I'll complete this when I have time.
